# Bolivia-Escobari-Hoover
 Code and data related to response to Escobari and Hoover (2020)

NOTE: on line 83 of newEscobari.do I intended "proc" to read "munc". Because idLoc should be unique within Departamento anyway (and therefore both procode and munccode) I don't believe this has any effect on any analysis whatsoever.
